[DEMO Linl](https://andrij-nalyvayko.github.io/Stopwatch/)



- "Start / Stop" - stops and resets the timer value.

- "Wait" - works on a double click (the time between clicks is not more than 300 ms!). The timer must stop counting down, if you press start after it, then the countdown is resumed.

- "Reset" - resets the stopwatch to 0. Resets the stopwatch and starts counting again.
